# Simon Game

## Description
This Simon Game is a web-based application that I developed as part of my full stack web development course. The objective of the game is to test and improve memory skills by repeating a sequence of button presses generated by the computer.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press any key of the keyboard to start the game.

2. **Pay Attention**: Watch and listen carefully as the buttons light up and play sounds.

3. **Repeat the Sequence**: After the computer makes a sequence of button presses, it's your turn to repeat the same sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.

4. **Keep Going**: The game will add one more step to the sequence each time you successfully repeat the pattern. Keep playing and see how long you can remember!

5. **Game Over**: If you make a mistake and click the wrong button or take too long to respond, the game will end. But don't worry; you can always restart the game by pressing any key of your keyboard.

## How to Run the Game

To run the Simon Game on your computer:

1. Make sure you have a web browser installed (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).

2. You can play the game directly through this [live link](https://rajan2217.github.io/SimonGame/). Simply click it, and you're ready to play!

## Technologies Used

The Simon Game was built using simple web technologies:

- HTML: For the structure of the game.
- CSS: For the visual styling and layout.
- JavaScript: For the game logic and interactivity.
